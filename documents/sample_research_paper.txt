Title: Neural Networks for Document Processing
Authors: John Smith, Jane Doe

Abstract:
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to using neural networks for document processing and question-answering systems. We explore various architectures including transformers and attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance in document understanding tasks.

1. Introduction
Document processing has become increasingly important in the era of big data. Traditional methods often fall short when dealing with complex document structures, multi-modal content, and semantic understanding requirements.

2. Methodology
Our approach combines several key components:
- Multi-modal content extraction using advanced PDF processing
- Semantic chunking with overlap preservation
- Vector-based similarity search using embeddings
- Context-aware response generation

3. Experimental Results
We evaluated our system on various benchmarks:
- Accuracy: 95.2%
- F1-Score: 0.94
- Precision: 96.1%
- Recall: 92.3%

The results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods.

4. Conclusion
Our neural network-based document processing system achieves excellent performance across multiple evaluation metrics. The combination of multi-modal processing and semantic understanding enables robust question-answering capabilities.
